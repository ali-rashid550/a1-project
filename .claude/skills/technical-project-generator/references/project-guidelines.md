# Detailed Project Generation Guidelines

This reference provides comprehensive guidance for implementing the project generation framework.

## 1. Analyzing Technical Concepts

### Key Idea Identification
- Extract the core functionality or principle
- Determine what the concept is typically used for
- Identify the main components or steps involved
- Recognize the inputs, processes, and outputs

### Audience Assessment
- Determine if the learner is a complete beginner or has some experience
- Assess what prerequisites they might need
- Consider their likely goals (learning vs. portfolio vs. practical use)

### Purpose Recognition
- Understand the real-world applications
- Identify common implementations
- Note typical challenges or pitfalls

## 2. Creating Effective Project Ideas

### Characteristics of Good Projects
- **Achievable**: Can be completed in 2-4 hours by a beginner
- **Meaningful**: Demonstrates the concept clearly
- **Practical**: Solves a realistic problem or simulates real usage
- **Scalable**: Can be extended with additional features
- **Educational**: Reinforces the core concept

### Project Diversity
- Offer different complexity levels (simple, intermediate, advanced)
- Provide different application domains (web, data, automation, etc.)
- Include different implementation approaches when applicable

## 3. Project Structure Template

### Project Title
- Descriptive but concise (under 6 words ideal)
- Includes the main technology or concept
- Indicates the application or purpose

### Short Description
- 1-2 sentences explaining what the project does
- Highlights the real-world value
- Mentions the key concept being applied

### Implementation Steps
- Number each step clearly (1, 2, 3...)
- Include estimated time for each step
- Specify required tools or libraries
- Explain the purpose of each step
- Include code snippets or examples where helpful

### Real-World Use Cases
- At least one specific scenario where this would be useful
- Mention similar applications in industry
- Connect to career or learning benefits

## 4. Language Guidelines

### Beginner-Friendly Approach
- Define technical terms when first used
- Explain the "why" behind each action
- Use analogies when helpful
- Acknowledge potential difficulties
- Provide troubleshooting tips

### Clear Instructions
- Use imperative language ("Create a file", "Install the library")
- Be specific about expected outcomes
- Include expected outputs or behaviors
- Mention common errors and solutions

## 5. Sample Project Categories

### Web-Based Projects
- Interactive web applications
- Data visualization dashboards
- API integration tools
- Form processing utilities

### Data-Focused Projects
- Data analysis scripts
- Visualization tools
- Report generators
- Data cleaning utilities

### Automation Projects
- File processing tools
- Schedule automation
- Data synchronization
- Notification systems

### Educational Projects
- Concept demonstrators
- Learning games
- Interactive tutorials
- Simulation tools

## 6. Auto-Save Implementation

After generating projects, automatically save them as .md files in the practice_problems folder:

1. Create the practice_problems folder if it doesn't exist
2. Generate a filename based on the concept name
3. Save the complete project ideas to the file
4. Confirm to the user that the projects have been saved
