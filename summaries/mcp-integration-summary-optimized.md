# MCP Integration: Exam Preparation Summary for Complete Beginners

## Main Goal
Understand how Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects Claude Code to external systems safely.

## Section 1: Core Definitions
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A standardized protocol that safely connects Claude to external systems (like a secure phone directory that connects your office assistant to approved external experts)
- **MCP Server**: A helper tool that acts as a bridge between Claude and external systems (like a specialist consultant you can call when you need specific expertise)
- **Skills**: Predefined workflows that encode expertise and procedures (like instruction manuals that teach Claude how to perform specific tasks)
- **Data Pipes**: Connections that provide access to live data sources (like secure tunnels that bring external information into your workspace)

## Section 2: Key Concepts
- MCP solves the limitation of Claude Code only seeing local files on your computer
- MCP safely connects Claude to external systems like websites, databases, and APIs
- Skills provide "how-to" knowledge while MCP provides "with-what" connections
- Different MCP servers specialize in different external systems
- Security is maintained through trusted servers and permission controls
- MCP bridges the gap between local context and external intelligence

## Section 3: Step-by-Step Processes
1. **Understanding the Problem**: Claude Code starts with access only to files on your computer
2. **Introducing MCP Solution**: MCP creates safe, standardized connections to external systems
3. **Learning MCP-Skills Relationship**: Skills teach Claude how to do things; MCP provides what it needs
4. **Identifying MCP Server Types**: Different servers specialize in different external systems
5. **Installing MCP Servers**: Use commands like `claude mcp add --transport stdio`
6. **Using MCP in Practice**: Connect Claude to external resources while maintaining security

## Section 4: Importance/Relevance
MCP is crucial because it expands Claude's capabilities beyond your local codebase. Without MCP, AI is limited to your files. With MCP, AI can browse documentation, fetch real-time data, and interact with external services through secure, permission-controlled protocols.

## Section 5: Memory Aids
- **Acronym**: MCP = "Make Claude Powerful" - it connects Claude to everything outside your computer in a safe way!
- **Office Assistant Analogy**: Think of Claude Code as an office worker who can only use documents on their desk; MCP is like giving them a phone book with approved contacts to call external experts
- **Bridge Metaphor**: MCP acts as a safe bridge connecting your local files to external systems

## Section 6: Key Takeaways for Exams
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) safely connects Claude to external systems
- Skills provide expertise while MCP provides data connections
- Different MCP servers specialize in different external systems (Playwright for web browsing, Context7 for documentation, GitHub for repositories, Database for data)
- You can add MCP servers with simple commands like `claude mcp add`
- Security is maintained through trusted servers and permission controls
- MCP bridges the gap between local context and external intelligence
