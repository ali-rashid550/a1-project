# Troubleshooting Guide

This reference provides detailed guidance for handling common issues when generating practice problems and mini-projects.

## Common Issue Types

### 1. Complexity Mismatch
Sometimes projects may be too complex or too simple for the target audience.

**Signs of being too complex:**
- Too many technologies/libraries required
- Multiple challenging concepts combined
- Requires advanced knowledge not covered in the lesson
- Steps are too numerous or intricate

**Signs of being too simple:**
- Can be completed in under 1 hour
- Lacks sufficient challenge for learning
- Minimal practical value
- Doesn't demonstrate the concept adequately

**Solutions:**
- Adjust the scope based on target skill level
- Add or remove integration points
- Include more or fewer features based on learning goals
- Balance challenge with achievable outcomes

### 2. Lack of Real-World Relevance
Projects may feel disconnected from practical applications.

**Improvement strategies:**
- Connect to actual industry scenarios
- Use realistic data or inputs
- Simulate real business problems
- Reference actual applications of the concept

### 3. Insufficient Guidance
Implementation steps may be unclear or incomplete.

**What to include:**
- Specific tools and libraries to use
- Expected outputs at each stage
- Common error messages and solutions
- Alternative approaches when relevant

### 4. Poor Concept Connection
Projects may not clearly demonstrate the target concept.

**Ensure connection by:**
- Making the core concept central to the project
- Including specific examples of the concept in action
- Explaining how the project demonstrates the concept
- Providing reflection questions about the concept-application relationship

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing project ideas, check:

- [ ] Project can be completed in 2-4 hours by target audience
- [ ] Implementation steps are clear and sequential
- [ ] Required tools/technologies are reasonable for the audience
- [ ] The core concept is clearly demonstrated
- [ ] Real-world relevance is evident
- [ ] Beginner-friendly language is used throughout
- [ ] Expected learning outcomes are clear
- [ ] Potential challenges are anticipated and addressed

## Iteration Guidelines

If a project idea receives negative feedback:

1. Identify the specific issue (complexity, relevance, clarity, etc.)
2. Adjust the problematic aspect without changing the core concept
3. Re-evaluate against the target audience's needs
4. Consider alternative approaches to the same learning goals
5. Test the revised idea mentally for feasibility

## Feedback Integration

When users provide feedback on generated projects:

- Note which aspects worked well
- Identify common concerns or issues
- Adjust the generation approach accordingly
- Document patterns that lead to successful vs. unsuccessful projects
