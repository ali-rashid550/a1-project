# AI-Driven Teacher System

Educational materials for AI-driven teacher systems and related technologies.

## Project Overview

The AI-Driven Teacher project is an educational AI system that transforms complex technical lessons into accessible explanations, generates practical projects for hands-on learning, and creates comprehensive exam preparation summaries. Designed specifically for complete beginners in technical subjects.

For complete project documentation including goals, constraints, and directory structure, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
