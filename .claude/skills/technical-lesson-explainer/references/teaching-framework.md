# Detailed Teaching Guidelines

This reference provides detailed guidance for implementing the 7-step teaching framework.

## 1) Main Goal
- State the main goal of the lesson in simple terms (1–2 sentences)
- Explain what knowledge the learner should walk away with
- Focus on the core concept being taught
- Avoid technical jargon in the goal statement

## 2) Lesson Outline
- Break the lesson into logical chunks/sections
- Provide a clear ordered outline of what will be covered
- Each section should have a simple descriptive title
- Organize from basic concepts to more complex ones
- Ensure sections build logically on each other

## 3) Key Terms Table
- Extract the 5–10 essential technical terms from the lesson
- For each term, include:
  - Term
  - Simple definition
  - Real-world analogy
- Present this in a clean table format
- Choose terms that are essential for understanding the lesson

Example table format:
| Term | Simple Definition | Real-world Analogy |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| API | Way for programs to talk to each other | Waiter taking your order to the kitchen |

## 4) Teach Each Section
- Explain concepts in very simple English without jargon
- Give real-world examples or analogies that beginners easily understand
- Include step-by-step explanations when needed
- Clarify how parts relate to each other and to the whole system
- Use concrete examples rather than abstract explanations

## 5) Why This Is Important
- Explain why the lesson matters in technical terms
- Connect it to real use cases, modern technologies, or common problems
- Answer: "Why should a beginner care about this?"
- Highlight practical benefits or consequences

## 6) When You Would Use It
- Describe practical scenarios where these ideas are used
- Include 1–2 simple use cases (e.g., in software, hardware, everyday tools, real jobs)
- Keep examples relatable
- Mention industry applications if relevant

## 7) Summary
- Provide a clear summary in bullet points
- Capture the whole lesson in concise, digestible takeaways
- Highlight the most important concepts
- Reinforce key learning objectives
