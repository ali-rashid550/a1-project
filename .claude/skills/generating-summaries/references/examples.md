# Topic: Introduction to Web Development

## Main Goal
Understand the basic components of web development and how they work together.

## Section 1: Core Definitions
- **HTML**: The structure of a webpage (like the skeleton of a house)
- **CSS**: The styling that makes webpages look attractive (like painting and decorating)
- **JavaScript**: The programming language that adds interactivity (like the electrical system)

## Section 2: Key Concepts
- HTML creates the basic structure of webpages
- CSS controls the appearance and layout
- JavaScript adds functionality and user interaction
- These three technologies work together to create modern websites

## Section 3: Step-by-Step Processes
1. Create HTML structure with semantic tags
2. Style the page with CSS for visual appeal
3. Add JavaScript for interactive elements
4. Test across different browsers for compatibility

## Section 4: Importance/Relevance
Web development fundamentals are essential for creating any modern website or web application.

## Section 5: Memory Aids
- **HCS**: HTML-CSS-JavaScript - the three pillars of web development
- **HTML is structure**, **CSS is skin**, **JS is behavior**

## Section 6: Key Takeaways for Exams
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript serve different purposes
- They must work together to create complete web experiences
- Each technology has its own syntax and rules
```

## Example 2: Advanced Structure

# Topic: Database Normalization

## Main Goal
Learn how to organize database tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## Section 1: Core Definitions
- **Normalization**: The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy
- **Normal Forms**: Rules that define levels of normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- **Functional Dependency**: When one attribute determines another attribute

## Section 2: Key Concepts
- Normalization eliminates data redundancy
- Higher normal forms provide better data integrity
- Each normal form has specific requirements
- Denormalization might be needed for performance in some cases

## Section 3: Step-by-Step Processes
1. Identify repeating groups and eliminate them (1NF)
2. Remove partial dependencies (2NF)
3. Remove transitive dependencies (3NF)
4. Verify all requirements are met

## Section 4: Importance/Relevance
Proper normalization prevents data anomalies and maintains database integrity.

## Section 5: Memory Aids
- **1NF**: Eliminate repeating groups
- **2NF**: No partial dependencies
- **3NF**: No transitive dependencies
- **FIND**: Find, Identify, Normalize, Document

## Section 6: Key Takeaways for Exams
- Normalization reduces data redundancy
- Each normal form has specific requirements
- Balance normalization with performance needs
